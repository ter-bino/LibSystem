# LibSystem
# Library-Management-System
A Library Management System program that can be used for tracking records in a library.

Anyone is free to use the program or improve it however they want, maybe just give me credits?

I have no idea how GitHub works, but I uploaded the project here anyways.

An executable file with sample data is available here:<br>
